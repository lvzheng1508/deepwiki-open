Building on the initial research plan, I'm now focusing on the **System Architecture and Error Handling** aspects of the calculator application.

**Deep Dive into Calculator Class Architecture:**

The Calculator class demonstrates a clean object-oriented design with the following key architectural patterns:

1. **Encapsulation**: All arithmetic operations are encapsulated within the Calculator class
2. **State Management**: The `history` attribute maintains a list of calculation records
3. **Method Design**: Each operation follows a consistent pattern:
   - Type hints for parameters and return values
   - Comprehensive docstrings with Args and Returns sections
   - History logging for each operation
   - Consistent return of float results

**Error Handling Architecture:**

The division method showcases robust error handling:
```python
if b == 0:
    raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
```

This follows Python best practices by:
- Using specific exception types (ValueError)
- Providing clear, descriptive error messages
- Failing fast when invalid input is detected

**Testing Strategy Analysis:**

The test suite (`test_calculator.py`) demonstrates comprehensive testing coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Each method has dedicated test cases
- **Error Testing**: Specific test for division by zero scenario
- **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test fixture management with `setUp()`
- **Assertion Patterns**: Uses `assertRaises` for exception testing

**New Insights for Wiki Structure:**

Based on this deeper analysis, the wiki should include:
1. **Architecture Diagrams**: Class diagram showing Calculator structure
2. **Error Handling Section**: Detailed explanation of exception handling
3. **Testing Documentation**: Coverage of the testing strategy
4. **Code Quality**: Discussion of type hints and documentation standards"""

    llm_response = """## Research Update 3

Now focusing on **Data Management and Configuration** aspects, building on the previous architecture analysis.

**Data Management Architecture:**

The calculator implements a sophisticated data management system:

1. **History Management**: 
   - In-memory storage using Python list
   - Immutable access via `get_history()` returning a copy
   - Memory management with `clear_history()` method
   - String-based history format: `"{a} + {b} = {result}"`

2. **Configuration System**:
   - Centralized configuration in `config.py`
   - Separation of concerns: settings vs. business logic
   - Extensible error message system
   - Configurable display and behavior options

**Key Configuration Insights:**

```python
DEFAULT_PRECISION = 2
MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 100
ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'division_by_zero': 'Cannot divide by zero',
    'invalid_input': 'Invalid input provided', 
    'overflow': 'Result too large'
}
```

This reveals the application's design for:
- **Extensibility**: Easy to modify precision and limits
- **Internationalization**: Centralized error messages
- **Scalability**: Configurable history size limits

**Main Function Analysis:**

The `main()` function demonstrates:
- **Usage Patterns**: Shows how to instantiate and use the calculator
- **Error Handling**: Demonstrates try-catch for division by zero
- **User Interface**: Simple console-based interaction
- **Testing Integration**: Built-in demonstration of all operations

**Wiki Structure Refinements:**

Based on this analysis, the wiki should emphasize:
1. **Configuration Management**: How to customize calculator behavior
2. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of history management
3. **Usage Examples**: Real-world usage patterns from main()
4. **Extensibility Guide**: How to modify and extend the calculator"""

2. **Context Accumulation**: RAG provides relevant code chunks for each iteration
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Different system prompts guide different research depths
4. **Topic Consistency**: All iterations focus on the same original query
5. **Progressive Depth**: From overview ‚Üí architecture ‚Üí details ‚Üí synthesis
6. **WebSocket Streaming**: Real-time delivery of research findings
7. **Final Synthesis**: Comprehensive conclusion integrating all research

üöÄ **Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Constructs initial request with file tree and README
- **Backend**: Processes through 5-iteration DeepResearch workflow
- **RAG**: Provides relevant code context for each iteration
- **LLM**: Generates progressively deeper analysis
- **WebSocket**: Streams responses in real-time
- **Final Output**: Structured wiki with comprehensive documentation

üí° **This demonstrates how DeepWiki transforms a simple codebase into**
**a comprehensive, well-structured documentation wiki through intelligent**
**multi-turn analysis and synthesis."""
